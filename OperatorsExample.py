# types of operators in python
# Aritmatic Operators
# Assignment Operators
# Comparission operators
# Logical operators
# Identity Operators
# Membership Operators
# Bitwise Operators


# Aritmatic Operators
print("5 + 6 is ",5+6)
print("5 - 6 is ",5-6)
print("5 * 6 is ",5*6)
print("5 / 6 is ",5/6) # this will give float value
print("5 % 6 is ",5%6)
print("5 // 6 is ",6//4) # this will give integer value ,floor division operator
print("5 ** 6 is ",5**2) # 5 raise to 2

# Assignment
print("Assignment operators")
x = 5
print(x)
x += 7 # this means  x = x + 7
print(x)

# Comparission operators
print("Comparission operators")
i= 8
print(i == 8)

# Logical operators
print("Logical operators")
a = True
b = False
print(a or b)

# Identity
print("Identity Operators")
a = True
b = False

print( a is b)

print( a is not b)


# Membership Operators
print("Membership Operators")

list = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
print(1 in list)

# Bitwise Operators
print("Bitwise Operators")
print(0 & 2)
print(0 | 2)
